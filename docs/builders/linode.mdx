# Linode Builder

Type: `linode`
Artifact BuilderId: `packer.linode`

The `linode` Packer builder is able to create [Linode
Images](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/disk-images/linode-images/) for
use with [Linode](https://www.linode.com). The builder takes a source image,
runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots
it into a reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the
foundation of new servers that are launched within Linode.

The builder does _not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

### Installation

To install this plugin using Packer v1.7.0 or later, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration.

Then, run [`packer init`](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init).

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    linode = {
      version = ">= 1.0.1"
      source  = "github.com/linode/linode"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder. In addition to the options defined there, a private key file
can also be supplied to override the typical auto-generated key:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Private-Key-File-not-required.mdx'

-->

### Required

- `linode_token` (string) - The client TOKEN to use to access your account.
  Alternatively, you can set your token as an environment variable named
  `LINODE_TOKEN`. Saving the token in the environment or centralized vaults
  can reduce the risk of the token being leaked from the codebase.

- `image` (string) - An Image ID to deploy the Disk from. Official Linode
  Images start with `linode/`, while user Images start with `private/`. See
  [images](https://api.linode.com/v4/images) for more information on the
  Images available for use. Examples are `linode/debian9`, `linode/fedora28`,
  `linode/ubuntu18.04`, `linode/arch`, and `private/12345`.

- `region` (string) - The id of the region to launch the Linode instance in.
  Images are available in all regions, but there will be less delay when
  deploying from the region where the image was taken. See
  [regions](https://api.linode.com/v4/regions) for more information on the
  available regions. Examples are `us-east`, `us-central`, `us-west`,
  `ap-south`, `ca-east`, `ap-northeast`, `eu-central`, and `eu-west`.

- `instance_type` (string) - The Linode type defines the pricing, CPU, disk,
  and RAM specs of the instance. See [instance types](https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types)
  for more information on the available Linode instance types. Examples are `g6-nanode-1`,
  `g6-standard-2`, `g6-highmem-16`, and `g6-dedicated-16`.

### Optional

- `authorized_keys` (list) - Public SSH keys need to be appended to the Linode instance.

- `authorized_users` (list) - Users whose SSH keys need to be appended to the Linode instance.

- `instance_label` (string) - The name assigned to the Linode Instance.

- `instance_tags` (list) - Tags to apply to the instance when it is created.

- `swap_size` (int) - The disk size (MiB) allocated for swap space.

- `interface` ([](Interface)[#interface]) - Network Interfaces
  to add to this Linode’s Configuration Profile. Singular repeatable block containing a `purpose`,
  a `label`, and an `ipam_address` field.

- `image_label` (string) - The name of the resulting image that will appear
  in your account. Defaults to `packer-{{timestamp}}` (see [configuration
  templates](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) for more info).

- `image_description` (string) - The description of the resulting image that
  will appear in your account. Defaults to "".

- `state_timeout` (string) - The time to wait, as a duration string, for the
  Linode instance to enter a desired state (such as "running") before timing
  out. The default state timeout is "5m".

- `image_create_timeout` (string) - The time to wait, as a duration string, for the
  disk image to be created successfully before timing out.
  The default image creation timeout is "10m".

- `private_ip` (bool) - If true, the created Linode will have private networking
  enabled and assigned a private IPv4 address.

- `root_pass` (string) - The root password of the Linode instance for building the image.
  Please note that when you create a new Linode instance with a private image, you will
  be required to setup a new root password.

#### Interface

This section outlines the fields configurable for a single interface object.

- `purpose` (string) - The purpose of this interface. (public, vlan, vpc)

- `primary` (bool) - Whether this interface is a primary interface.

VLAN-specific fields:

- `label` (string) - The label of the VLAN this interface relates to.

- `ipam_address` (string) - This Network Interface’s private IP address in CIDR notation.

VPC-specific fields:

- `subnet_id` (int) - The ID of the VPC Subnet this interface references.

- `ipv4` (block) - The IPv4 configuration of this VPC interface.

    - `vpc` (string) - The IPv4 address from the VPC subnet to use for this interface.

    - `nat_1_1` (string) - The public IPv4 address assigned to this Linode to be 1:1 NATed with the VPC IPv4 address.

## Examples

### Basic Example

Here is a Linode builder example. The `linode_token` should be replaced with an
actual [Linode Personal Access
Token](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token)
or in the config file or the environmental variable, `LINODE_TOKEN`.
