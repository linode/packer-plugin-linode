Type: `linode-image`

The Linode Image data source matches or filters the ID or label of both public images on
Linode and private images in your account using regular expression (regex) or an exact
match.

You can get the latest list of available public images on Linode via the
[Linode Image List API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-images).

## Examples

```hcl
data "linode-image" "latest_ubuntu" {
    id_regex = "linode/ubuntu.*"
    latest = true
}

source "linode" "example" {
  image             = data.linode-image.latest_ubuntu.id
  image_description = "My Private Image"
  image_label       = "my-packaer-private-linode-image-test"
  instance_label    = "temporary-linode-image"
  instance_type     = "g6-nanode-1"
  region            = "us-mia"
  ssh_username      = "root"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.linode.example"]
}
```

```hcl
data "linode-image" "latest_ubuntu_lts" {
    label_regex = "Ubuntu [0-9]+\\.[0-9]+ LTS"
    latest = true
}
```

```hcl
data "linode-image" "ubuntu22_lts" {
    id = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    latest = true
}
```

- `label` (string) - Matching the label of an image by exact label

- `label_regex` (string) - Matching the label of an image by a regular expression

- `id` (string) - Matching the ID of an image by exact ID

- `id_regex` (string) - Matching the ID of an image by a regular expression

- `latest` (bool) - Whether to use the latest created image when there are multiple matches

- `linode_token` (string) - The Linode API token required for provision Linode resources.
  This can also be specified in `LINODE_TOKEN` environment variable.
  Saving the token in the environment or centralized vaults
  can reduce the risk of the token being leaked from the codebase.
  `images:read_write`, `linodes:read_write`, and `events:read_only`
  scopes are required for the API token.
