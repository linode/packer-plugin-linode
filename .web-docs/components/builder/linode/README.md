Type: `linode`
Artifact BuilderId: `packer.linode`

The `linode` Packer builder is able to create [Linode
Images](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/disk-images/linode-images/) for
use with [Linode](https://www.linode.com). The builder takes a source image,
runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots
it into a reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the
foundation of new servers that are launched within Linode.

The builder does _not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder. In addition to the options defined there, a private key file
can also be supplied to override the typical auto-generated key:

- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory
  of current user.

### Required

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the LinodeCommon struct in helper/common.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `linode_token` (string) - The Linode API token required for provision Linode resources.
  This can also be specified in `LINODE_TOKEN` environment variable.
  Saving the token in the environment or centralized vaults
  can reduce the risk of the token being leaked from the codebase.
  `images:read_write`, `linodes:read_write`, and `events:read_only`
  scopes are required for the API token.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/linode/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `region` (string) - The id of the region to launch the Linode instance in. Images are available in all
  regions, but there will be less delay when deploying from the region where the image
  was taken. See [regions](https://api.linode.com/v4/regions) for more information on
  the available regions. Examples are `us-east`, `us-central`, `us-west`, `ap-south`,
  `ca-east`, `ap-northeast`, `eu-central`, and `eu-west`.

- `instance_type` (string) - The Linode type defines the pricing, CPU, disk, and RAM specs of the instance. See
  [instance types](https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types) for more information on the
  available Linode instance types. Examples are `g6-nanode-1`, `g6-standard-2`,
  `g6-highmem-16`, and `g6-dedicated-16`.

- `image` (string) - An Image ID to deploy the Disk from. Official Linode Images start with `linode/`,
  while user Images start with `private/`. See [images](https://api.linode.com/v4/images)
  for more information on the Images available for use. Examples are `linode/debian9`,
  `linode/fedora28`, `linode/ubuntu18.04`, `linode/arch`, and `private/12345`.

  a private IPv4 address.

  you create a new Linode instance with a private image, you will be required to setup a
  new root password.

  in your account. Defaults to `packer-{{timestamp}}` (see [configuration
  templates](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) for more info).

- `state_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait, as a duration string, for the Linode instance to enter a desired state
  (such as "running") before timing out. The default state timeout is "5m".

- `stackscript_data` (map[string]string) - This attribute is required only if the StackScript being deployed requires input data from
  the User for successful completion. See User Defined Fields (UDFs) for more details.
  
  This attribute is required to be valid JSON.

- `stackscript_id` (int) - A StackScript ID that will cause the referenced StackScript to be run during deployment
  of this Linode. A compatible image is required to use a StackScript. To get a list of
  available StackScript and their permitted Images see /stackscripts. This field cannot
  be used when deploying from a Backup or a Private Image.

- `image_create_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait, as a duration string, for the disk image to be created successfully
  before timing out. The default image creation timeout is "10m".

- `cloud_init` (bool) - Whether the newly created image supports cloud-init.

- `metadata` (Metadata) - An object containing user-defined data relevant to the creation of Linodes.

- `firewall_id` (int) - The ID of the Firewall to attach this Linode to upon creation.

## Examples

### Basic Example

Here is a Linode builder example. The `linode_token` should be replaced with an
actual [Linode Personal Access
Token](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/#get-an-access-token)
or in the config file or the environmental variable, `LINODE_TOKEN`.

**HCL2**

```hcl

locals { timestamp = regex_replace(timestamp(), "[- TZ:]", "") }

source "linode" "example" {
  image             = "linode/debian11"
  image_description = "My Private Image"
  image_label       = "private-image-${local.timestamp}"
  instance_label    = "temporary-linode-${local.timestamp}"
  instance_type     = "g6-nanode-1"
  linode_token      = "YOUR API TOKEN"
  region            = "us-mia"
  ssh_username      = "root"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.linode.example"]
}

```

**JSON**

```json

  "source": {
